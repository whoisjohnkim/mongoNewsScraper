## Description
This web app will scrape the Yahoo News website for article headlines and links and display them for the user. The user will have the option of saving the article which they can view on a separate page, or comment on the articles.

Scraped articles will not repeat in the database and data is persistent so neither the articles nor the comments will disappear unless the database is reset.
